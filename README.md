# factoid_QA_with_distant_spervision

Codes for [Factoid Question Answering With Distant Supervision](http://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/20/6/439/pdf). 

I am cleaning the codes for uploading, and some description should be added. 



### Requirements
- GPU and CUDA 8 are required
- python >=3.5 
- pytorch 0.3.0
- pandas
- msgpack
- spacy 1.x
- cupy
- pynvrtc
- jieba

### Download Data
Please download data files from [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EI47PfmeZRfpAUdNq2EI7um_sxlV8prv?usp=sharing), and put the files under the "dat" file. 
Specifically, download these four files, 
```
questions_dis_data_150htmls_using_abstext.txt
triple_weight_by_search.txt
new_mined_paraphrase0124.txt
WebQA.v1.0.tar.gz   # is it proper to upload this dataset? 
```
Then unzip the WebQA data with ```tar -zxvf WebQA.v1.0.tar.gz```. 

### Model training
Train the model via runing 

```
cd DSRC
mkdir logs
python train_model.py
```

Please refer to ```parameters.py``` for configuration details, where ```train_idx``` is consponding to different experimental configurations in the paper.
